                        <em>Journeta</em>
                        is a dirt simple library for <em>peer discovery</em>
                        and <em>message passing</em>
                        between <em>Ruby</em>
                        applications on a LAN.

                        <p>
                            A “peer” is represented by a “start”ed instance of JournetaEngine in your Ruby application. You’ll probably want just one, but may run more if it makes sense for your application to logically represent two (or more) peers simultaneously, or want to run multiple instances on the same machine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Any object that can be serialized via YAML can be sent and received by Journeta. Received messages (a.k.a. objects defined by your application sent from a peer running the same code) are passed into a message handler you provide in an event-based manner. Messages do not come from your applications main thread!
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>

                                <h3>Work outside the LAN</h3>Presence broadcasts don’t propagate to the internet, and there is no such thing as a “server” in Journeta.

                            <li>
                                <h3>Currently use secure channels</h3>All network messages are currently sent in raw form across the network, and messages from peers are implicitly authorized. Engine-level support for encryption and authentication will be coming in the future.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Dictate your message handling model</h3>Remember that events sent to your message handler each come from their own thread, and sometimes concurrently. Update only thread-safe data structure and/or design out the problem.

                                <h3>Guarantee backwards compatibility</h3>No formal messaging specifications here. We will try to maintain interface compatibility between point releases (for example between 0.1.0 and 0.1.1), but we don't normally compatibility test across releases so your milage may vary.
                            </li>
