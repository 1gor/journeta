    <h2>Ruby <span class="caps">P2P</span> for your <span class="caps">LAN</span>, yo.</h2>


	<p>Journeta is a library for passing objects between automatically discovered and connected Ruby applications on a <span class="caps">LAN</span>.</p>


	<h2>Peers</h2>


	<p>A &#8220;peer&#8221; is represented by a &#8220;start&#8221;ed instance of JournetaEngine in your Ruby application. You&#8217;ll probably want just one, but may run more if it makes sense for your application to logically represent two (or more) peers simultaneously.</p>


	<p>Any object that can be serialized via <span class="caps">YAML</span> can be sent and received by Journeta. Received messages (a.k.a. objects defined by your application sent from a peer) are passed into a message handler you define, in an event-based manner. Message do not come from your applications main thread.</p>


	<h2>Journeta Is Simple Because It Doesn&#8217;t..</h2>


<ol>
<li><b>Work outside the <span class="caps">LAN</span></b>. Presence broadcasts don&#8217;t propagate to the internet, and there is no such thing as a &#8220;server&#8221; in Journeta.</li>
<li><b>Attempt to be secure</b>, as all network messages are sent in text. Messages from peers are implicitly trusted for truthiness.</li>
<li><b>Solve Ruby&#8217;s threading issues</b>, nor dictate your applications thread handling design. Until Ruby uses native threads, high-performance uses of Journeta will likely be limited. Remember that stuff sent to your message handler is not coming from your applications main thread.</li>
<li><b>Provide backwards compatibility</b>, or for the matter, compatibility with anything other than peers of the same Journeta version. No formal messaging specifications here. Different versions of Journeta may or may not be protocol compatible; we don&#8217;t know and we don&#8217;t keep track.</li>
<li><b>Guarantee message delivery</b>, since <span class="caps">UDP</span> is used for some types of communications, and peers are free to go down at any time.</li>
</ol>

	<h2>Installing</h2>


<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install journeta</pre>

	<h2>The Basics</h2>


	<p>Several annotated code snippets can be found in the &#8220;examples&#8221; directory of the gem. Open two consoles, and run this script (it comes with the gem) on each. You should see messages on each console showing received presence events. Hit <enter> in one consoles to shut down the peer, and look for an event message in the other. Sweeeeet.</p>
