						<em>Journeta</em> is a dirt simple library for <em>peer discovery</em> and <em>message passing</em> between <em>Ruby</em> applications on a LAN.

						Installing
					</h1>
					<div class="code">
						sudo gem install journeta
					</div>
					<h2>
						Examples
					</h2>
					<p>
						Several annotated code snippets can be found in the “examples” directory of the gem. Open two (or more) consoles and run and following on each for a completely decentralized, zero-configuration-required chat server.

						<h2>
							Peers
						</h2>
						<p>
							A “peer” is represented by a “start”ed instance of JournetaEngine in your Ruby application. You’ll probably want just one, but may run more if it makes sense for your application to logically represent two (or more) peers simultaneously, or want to run multiple instances on the same machine.
						</p>
						<p>
							Any object that can be serialized via <span class="caps">YAML</span> can be sent and received by Journeta. Received messages (a.k.a. objects defined by your application sent from a peer running the same code) are passed into a message handler you provide in an event-based manner. Messages do not come from your applications main thread!
						</p>
					</div>

						<h2>
							Journeta Is Simple Because It Doesn’t..
						</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<h3>Work outside the LAN</h3>Presence broadcasts don’t propagate to the internet, and there is no such thing as a “server” in Journeta.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Currently use secure channels</h3>All network messages are currently sent in RAW form across the network, and messages from peers are implicitly authorized. Engine-level support for encryption and authentication will be coming in the future.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Dictate your message handling model</h3>
								Remember that stuff sent to your message handler is not coming from your applications main thread!
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Provide backwards compatibility</h3>, or for the matter, compatibility with anything other than peers of the same Journeta version. No formal messaging specifications here. Different versions of Journeta may or may not be protocol compatible; we don’t know and we don’t keep track. We will try to maintain interface compatibilty between point releases (for example between 0.1.0 and 0.1.1).
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Guarantee message delivery</h3>UDP</span> is used for some types of communications, and peers are free to go down at any time.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>
							Coming Soon
						</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<h3>P2P encryption and handshaking</h3>. Communication currently are not secure and should only be used in a trusted environment
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Additional engine hooks</h3>. This will allow you to tap into internal workings of Journeta to override internal event handling mechanisms.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Preemptive peer reaping</h3> to remove peers for the engine if they have not been heard from in a while.
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3>Failure callbacks</h3> so your application may respond to peers going down before all outgoing information has been sent.
							</li>
